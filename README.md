# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple implementation of the classic word-guessing game. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the word letter by letter. 

## 📝 Description

The Hangman game allows a player to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. The game provides visual feedback for each incorrect guess, displaying the state of a hangman figure. The player wins if they can guess the word before the hangman figure is fully drawn.
